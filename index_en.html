    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Thalles Paiva and, more than a game developer, I'm someone driven by the desire to create worlds where people can feel free, welcomed, and alive. With a degree in Digital Games, I've been walking a path that combines technique, creativity, and purpose. I have experience as a game designer, level designer, and creative writer for artificial intelligence — and everything I do carries the same focus: to provoke real emotions, build memorable experiences, and, if possible, transform the world of those who play.</p>
    <p>Today, I seek to expand this mission by delving into areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, not only to expand my knowledge but to find new ways to touch people through technology. I believe games are more than entertainment — they are bridges, they are refuges, they are hope. And that's why I keep creating.</p>
